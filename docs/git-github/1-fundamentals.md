What is version control?
---------------------------
A Version Control System or also noun as Source Code Management (SCM) it's a system with the purpose to manage different versions of a document and create versions of this document. Git is not the only SCM, here are some others that I know:

* [TortoiseCVS](http://www.tortoisecvs.org/download.shtml)
* [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org)
* [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org)

They are responsible for versioning project files so you don't have to manually version them.

Other systems work with differences and Git works with file states.

What is GitHub?
----------------
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting platform of projects that use Git.

You can upload public repositories to share your codes with everyone or private them only for you and specific people you choose to add.

If you're reading this your probably at GitHub.
