Studies
------------

<p>My motivation with the creation of this repository was a talk with one of my Java Teachers that asked about how I was keeping track of my evolution with programming, so since I decided in go over some of my first projects I saw this as a good idea.</p>

<P>If with this I happen to help somebody with learning the technologies that I'm studying or help them review something programming related it will be a bless. If you got here I hope you understand my notes, grow with me and enjoy your time.</p>

<p>Technology is for everybody.</p>
